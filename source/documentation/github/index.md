# GitHub and Alphagov

GDS teams use [GitHub](https://github.com) as their default repository hosting and versioning service.

All GDS teams share one GitHub organization called [Alphagov](https://www.github.com/alphagov). Our GitHub organisation is on the [Enterprise Cloud](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products#github-enterprise) plan.
