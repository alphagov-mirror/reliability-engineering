## Access GitHub Alphagov

People joining GDS do not automatically have access to the GDS GitHub organisation, [Alphagov][]. To gain access:

- [Create a GitHub account][] if you don't have one already. Existing personal accounts are fine to continue using.
- Enable [two-factor authentication][] on your GitHub account.
- Give your GitHub username to your team's tech lead, or your nearest technical Senior Management Team member.


It’s the individual teams’ responsibility to grant that user access to relevant GDS [GitHub teams][]. 

Once setup is completed, staff can access GDS resources on [GitHub][] or via the command-line.
