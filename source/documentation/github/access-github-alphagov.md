## Access GitHub Alphagov

People joining GDS do not automatically have access to [Alphagov][] on [GitHub][]. To grant access to Alphagov, user needs to [create a new][] or share an existing GitHub username with the team. All users are required to enable [two-form authentication][] on their GitHub accounts.


It’s the individual teams’ responsibility to grant that user access to relevant Alphagov [teams][]. 

Once setup is completed, user can access Alphagov resources using the GitHub portal or [SSH connection] (https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
